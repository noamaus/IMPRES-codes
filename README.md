%%%%%%%%%%%%IMPRES codes


%%%System requirements: MATLAB has to be installed. 
%%%Version checked on: MATLAB 2014b, MATLAB 2017b and MATLAB 2018a.
%%%OS tested: mac OS 10.12.6 ans 10.10.5
%%%Typical running typme: excluding hilClibming.m, all codes run in a few
%%%minutes or less. 
%%%hilClibming.m - requires a long running time (typically 4-6 hours), and is
%%%commented in MAIN_CODES->Feature_selection->PART1 (line 13 with a warning  
%%%for the required running time), its output (RES.mat) is saved in the directory and 
%%%is ready



%%%%%%%%%%%%MAIN_CODES: Main codes for IMPRES
%%%Feature selection: Feature senection and construction of IMPRES score 
%%%using neuroblastoma data (run PART1.m)

%%%Melanoma Prediction: Predict immune response based on IMPRES score
%%%defined in PART1 (calculated on melanoma data, as is) for 9 datasets
%%%from 6 publicly available studies (run PART2.m)

%%%Survival analysis: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using IMPRES score
%%%for ICB treated patients and comparison of PFS between samples with high/low 
%%%IMPRES scores for data with annotations of PFS (run PART3.m)
